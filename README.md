# Yet Another Devkit
This is a Blender script that comes built into the Yet Another Devkit .blend file. It features a more responsive UI for working with the devkit as well as enabling certain functionality in [Yet Another Addon](https://github.com/Arrenval/Yet-Another-Addon).

A more extensive overview of the features can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WRKKUZZsAzDOTpt6F7iJkN8TDvwDBm0s0Z4DHdWqT_o/edit?usp=sharing).

You'll find the UI panel "Devkit" in the "XIV Kit" tab in the 3D Viewport.

## Installing
This script comes bundled with its compatible devkit. Generally, you can update the script after patch updates, but it's not recommended to do so unless instructed.

## Licensing

The code within this tool is made for the Blender API and follows its GPL3 licensing, read the *LICENSE.md* for details. However, I do humbly request that it does not be used for creating mods or assets that are behind a permanent paywall. This license does not apply to the assets within the devkit.
