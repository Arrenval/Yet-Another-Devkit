The code within this tool is made for the Blender API and follows its GPL3 licensing.

The code's implentation is specifically tailored for my "Yet Another Devkit",
and regarding its usage I do request that it does not be used for creating mods 
or assets that are behind a permanent paywall, three months at the most.
